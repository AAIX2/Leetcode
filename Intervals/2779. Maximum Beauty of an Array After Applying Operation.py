# Approach-1 (By converting to intervals and finding the max intervals we can get)
# T.C : O(nlogn)
# S.C : O(n)
# Mainly the intuition here is to see that we can convert each nums[i] into a range values which converts it into an interval based problem.

    # Step 1: Create ranges based on nums and k

# Approach-3 (Using Sliding Window)
# T.C : O(nlogn)
# S.C : O(1)

# Example:- 
# [4,6,1,2], k = 2

# Question says that we can "Replace nums[i] with any integer from the range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]".

# This means we can replace the element of the array with any value within the shown range below.

#                 [ 4   6   1   2 ]
# min of range =    2   4  -1   0     i.e. nums[i] - k 
# max of range =    6   8   3   4     i.e. nums[i] + k 

# Now, to be a "Beautiful Subsequence" all elements of the subsequence should be equal.

# All elements can be equal if the "max of range of minimum element is greater than equal to min of range of maxium element".
# Didn't get it ðŸ¤¯ no problem lets visulaize:- 

# for the above example ~
# Minimum Element = 1 and max of range of 1 = 3
# Maixium Element = 6 and min of range of 6 = 4

# this means if we replace 1 with max of it's range i.e. 3 and we replace 6 with min of it's range i.e. 4,
# still we can't make 1 and 6 equal.

# So what can we do is either increment minimum i.e. ignore 1 or decrement maximum i.e. ignore 6 both will work. I'll ignore the minimum i.e. 1.

# I think now this condition "max of range of minimum element is greater than equal to min of range of maxium element" makes sense ðŸ˜‰.

# Okay, now the next minimum is 2 as we have igonred 1. Lets check the condition.

# for the above example ~
# Minimum Element = 2 and max of range of 2 = 4
# Maixium Element = 6 and min of range of 6 = 4

# this means if we replace 2 with max of it's range i.e. 4 and we replace 6 with min of it's range i.e. 4,
# we can make 2 and 6 equal.

# So the number of elements in the "Beautiful Subsequence" is 3 as we have ignored element '1'.
